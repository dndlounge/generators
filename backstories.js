    list: ['<p><b>Personality Traits: My timidity often causes others to think I'm dimwitted, but I just like to think slowly. I'm also a bit of a know-it-all once I get talking.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Balance. I don't like taking too strong a stance on any issue. All intelligent creatures should find a way to coexist without childish bickering</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> As a child, I always spent time fishing on a local stream. Something foul corrupted the land before I departed, and I'd love to see my old spot restored.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I can be awfully judgmental, and it's hard for me to break a first impression.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You grew up with too many siblings to count and were free to make your own decisions from a young age. You often kept to yourself and made friends with hermits and other outsiders. Drawn to magic and adventure from an early age, you've gone out into the world in search of a more fulfilling life.', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm a straight shooter, and I sometimes say the wrong thing at the wrong time, making enemies where I have no intention. I'm much happier outside of civilization.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Wanderlust. Remaining in one place long is a good way to piss away your existence.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I found an ancient metal coin that has no tie to any kingdom I know -- I treasure it as a symbol of an unknown past.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I sabotage relationships before anyone gets too close.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Your whole life you've been chased. You never knew your parents and those who looked after you didn't for long. Always marked by destiny, that's what those who met you have muttered. The law, the Fey -- you're never able to settle anywhere long without being bothered. You've decided to embrace your fate and strike out in search of a grand discovery, perhaps even the origin of your fate-marked existence.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: While I'm smooth and graceful most of the time, I have a terrible fear of heights due to a childhood accident. I have a love of small creatures, who I try to befriend wherever I go.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Trust. Friends are where I put my faith, and I'll continue doing so even if I get burned.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> During my years in the war, I made two mates who I owe my life to -- I'd do anything for those two.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I don't like making decisions, relying on the wisdom of those around me instead.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A logger from a small settlement, you were swept up in a regional war between nobles. You made something of a name for yourself and decided there was nothing to return to at home after the war. Since then, you've taken work as a mercenary, bodyguard, and bouncer, but you have an itch to see more of the world.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: I only need people to like me for as long as I need them for something. Everyone's got a weakness, and I'm looking for it from the moment I meet you.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Vigor. The world belongs to those who with the will to take it. Nothing belongs to anyone forever.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I have a jeweled dagger I stole from my streetwise mentor -- the old fool should have never trusted me.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I get cocky about my scams and assume most people are idiots.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You've been scamming since you can first remember. You swindled your childhood friends' sweets, pulled card scams in your teenage years, and cheated your partner out of a business in your adult years. To you, the world is nothing but marks and grifters, and you're certain about which side you'd like to be on.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: A born coward, and not afraid to admit it! While the world and its secrets fascinate me, I shy away from any situation where I don't have an obvious advantage.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Safety. Everyone should be a whole lot safer -- there are monsters everywhere in this world!</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My sister is my best friend. She married a mysterious stranger a few years back, and I haven't seen her since.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'll do anything to get my hands on shiny gemstones and jewelry of all sorts.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Raised in relative privilege, your family was close friends with your town's reeve. Your father died of unknown causes, and one week after a swarthy handsome man arrived in town. One week later, he had paid a bride price worth more than the wealthiest family in town for your sister. The two of them were gone immediately after the ceremony. Deeply uncomfortable with the situation, you've set out to find any sign of the stranger and where he brought your sister.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: If I've got two coins to rub together, I'm spending them both on drink. I'm the life of a party unless I perceive an insult.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Revelry. Life is short, and every day should be celebrated</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My cousin carved me a flute when I was a child. I may not be able to carry a tune, but I carry it with me everywhere.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I can't take anything seriously, and serious people seriously annoy me.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You grew up in a pub in a good-sized town and have always been fascinated by strangers who pass through. Moderation and modesty are not your strong suits, and a recent incident involving you and the mayor's spouse has hastened your decision to leave town. That, and a healthy desire to see the lands you've heard strangers tell tales of.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: A born diplomat and disseminator, I thrive in any situation centered on intrigue. Gaining leverage over the powerful satisfies me like little else can.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Power. Knowing the right things about the right people ensures you'll get the right treatment in life.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My minor title was my greatest joy in life, and I will have it restored -- or something grander.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I look at unimportant people as expendable and unworthy of serious attention.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A self-made individual who rose your way up through the systems of power, you've gambled big and come out higher than you could've imagined. Until recently, when a jealous peer at court started spreading lies about you. Arrogant of your position, you allowed a faction to grow against you, and you've now been removed from the royal court and had your minor title eliminated.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: A contrarian who never accepts the status quo, I like to spread my forward way of thinking. I also love to watch the powerful fall.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Freedom. All deserve the freedom to make their own choices.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My people are my life -- the peasant class deserve a champion fighting for their rights.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm extremely judgmental of ostentatious displays.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You grew up in a place where a succession of tyrants rule. They forced the peasants to fight in expansionary battles and to clear out dangerous mines and quarries for extraction. You and a few other rebels fought back and tried to assassinate a local lord -- your comrades were killed, and you barely escaped with your life. Though it would be unwise to return now, you will not forever abandon your people to their evil fate.</p>""'<p><b>Personality Traits: I've always been curious about the nature of our reality and the path we should follow. My frequent practice of meditation and deep focus often makes me seem completely out of this world.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Truth. Nothing matters so much as clarity of mind and to serve as truth's witness.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> Even if I'm not accepted by the members of my faith, I love and serve my religion the best way I know how.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I often appeal strictly to reason, forgetting that emotions have their place as well.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You thought you had it all figured out -- a religion that made sense, a community you belonged to. But then it struck you: the teachings of an old master completely contradict the practice of your faith today. You tried to keep your ideas to yourself, but the elders learned of your dangerous way of thinking, and you've been exiled as a result.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: My hands are always open to friends and I strive to elude discord whenever I can. But once riled, I'll fight to the bitter end for the sake of those I love.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Community. Alone we are nothing -- together we are divine.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My kith and kin are everything to me, and my heart will be cold until their home has been restored.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm a bit short-sighted when it comes to considering the consequences of my actions.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A perfect childhood in a loving community -- you'd never have left if things had been up to you. But when the cave network your kin called home was overrun with giant spiders, you had no choice but to pack up and leave. You hope your travels uncover a way to drive away these vile beasts and restore the sanctity of your youth for a new generation to enjoy.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Daring and bold, I'm willing to gamble anything, because I haven't much to lose. A fiery attitude wins me just as many fast friends as fast foes.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Autonomy. While I enjoy company, I've learned it's best to have a plan for handling any situation on your own.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My aunt was the only one who stood by my side when everyone else turned on me -- I keep her scarf with me always.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm easily baited by someone telling me I can't or won't do something.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> As a youth, were dared to explore a haunted house in the dark wood near your village. Inside, you stumbled into Shadowfell, where a dark Wizard cursed you with a wound you carry to this day. Always healing, never healed, a grey-green patch marks the ribs on the right side of your body. Your family disowned you and the village shut you out once they saw, and you've been traveling alone in search of companionship ever since.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: An adaptive person, I've always been able to read a room and write them back in kind. Solving puzzles is one of life's chief pleasures.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Acumen. Any problem can be solved if you take stock of all the variables.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I keep a collection of coins from each of the lands I've visited.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I've been accused of shiftiness and refusing to take a firm stance on an issue.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> From high seas to royal courts to dingy taverns -- you've been around the world plying your trade as a merchant. Even before you 'settled down' into a mercantile profession, you were on the road as a performer in a traveling circus. You've lived enough for three, but one thing remains -- to venture into the dark and undiscovered places, and to test your mettle against whatever awaits.</p"'<p><b>Personality Traits: I have a natural right to rule and to be followed, for the wisdom of the ages runs through my blood. I don't suffer fools who need to be convinced of my inherent greatness.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Pedigree. Breeding is everything, and you rarely have to look beyond someone's parentage to know their worth.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> Before my exile, I managed to steal the crystal scepter that marks my land's rulers. It means more to me than my life.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> If I am interrupted, my fury cannot be controlled.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You should have ruled your land, if not for those halfwit advisors and conspiring family members. Your uncle moved swiftly once your father passed, and you were barely able to escape your home alive. Though powerless now, your birthright beckons to you -- you will one day return and wreak vengeance on those who wronged you.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm more comfortable in the world of my books than the world of society. The answer to everything has been written down somewhere; you just have to know where to look.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Research. Discovering new knowledge is life's greatest joy, and should be the ultimate pursuit of all thinking creatures.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> An illustrated book that I managed to take with me from the lord's household.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm scared witless of insects and arachnids. </p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were a bookish child of a lord's steward, but when your father was killed in a raid, you lost your privileged position. You weren't proud and took work where you could find it. What haunted you most about the experience was how you lost access to the books that raised you. Anything that brings you closer to knowledge, whether written down or the raw source, has motivated your movements ever since.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: There are a lot of crazy ways to do things, and I like to try each of them. I'm completely unfazed by social scrutiny and will always proceed in whatever way seems most natural.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Spontaneity. A plan is a story that fools write about a future that rarely comes to pass.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My mentor may have been completely off her rocker, but she raised me as her own -- I honor her memory in everything I do.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Having never seen polite society, I'm not quite sure what civilized behavior entails.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Playing in the woods as a child, you became lost. Maybe you fell into the Feywild, or perhaps you simply lost your way. You've never known one way or another. In any case, you were found by an eccentric hermit Druid who did her best to raise you. After her recent death, you've decided that the hermit life isn't for you, and so set out to see what the world is like beyond your woodland home.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm fascinated by dark iconography and lore pertaining to the Underdark and Shadowfell. Not smart but intellectually busy, I'm prone to conspiracy theories.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Awe. Standing witness before powerful figures is akin to encountering the divine.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A lucky rat's paw, from my first ever object of dissection.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My laugh sounds like a wheezing cough, and I can't help laughing at another's misfortune.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Up until recently, your world has been no larger than your tower walls and dark plot of forest. Raised by dark wizards who may or may not have really been your parents (they claimed they were), you've borne witness to rituals and cruelty of all sorts. While there was never a dull moment, you weren't exactly raised with ethics in mind. They are dead now -- how isn't important. What you do with their lessons is.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I don't usually question the status quo, although I've recently been rethinking things. I'd love a simple life, but answering my budding conscience won't allow for that.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Justice. It turns out good things don't always happen to good people, something I was a long time learning.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> You had a sweetheart in the town you fled from; one day, perhaps you'll see them again.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm a bit naive and trustworthy, but that's only because I like to have faith in people.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> An individual who believes in justice, you've always believed that systems of power inherently put the truly noble in positions of nobility. Until recently, that is. Serving as a bodyguard for a local noblemen's son, you witnessed him berate and torture innocent townfolk. You stepped in and struck him, and you've been hunted ever since.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Once a happy-go-lucky individual, I now have a sizeable chip on my shoulder. Laughter grates my ears, but there isn't a sound so sweet as an enemy choking on their blood.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Scorched Earth. Those who stand in the way of my designs are as villainous as the foes I hunt themselves.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My nephew, lost to me in the raids. I don't know what became of him.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Revelry sickens me, and idle conversation is for the wicked and the lazy alone.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Savages, black-hearted villains, foes of unspeakable cruelty -- these are just some of the names you have for the Orcs who haunt your dreams. Yours was a quiet hamlet with no resources worth raiding, but that didn't stop them. You lost everything but gained a new friend: hatred. It keeps you sharp and allows you to carry on, knowing that you will one day be an agent of demise to all who wrong the innocent.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm a bit neurotic after the escalating series of pranks that's been played on me throughout my life. But I swear I'm fairly normal once I stop wincing.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Mercy. People really ought to be forgiven for their mistakes, especially when they didn't even know what they were doing!</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My mother, scared catatonic by the fairy incursions.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I may not always take complete ownership of my mistakes, but who's to say that's my fault?</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Once as a youth, you swam in a mountain spring you happened across. You swear you meant no offense, but it turned out to be the sacred bathing grounds of a powerful forest spirit. Since then, the Fey have often treated you mischievously at best and as an outright enemy at worst. You have the deepest respect for the natural world, and hope to atone for your inadvertent sin one day.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Unfeeling toward most I meet, I prefer the deep places of the world. I have a dilettante's interest in magic, but my curiosity tends towards dark lore.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Misanthropy. The civilized world is anything but. At least beasts and monsters act according to their nature.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I found an injured baby wolf spider as a youth that I nursed back to health; I like to visit his cave from time to time.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I find beautiful people inherently untrustworthy.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Your early years are as fuzzy as a dream upon waking. From as young as you remember, though, you were in the service of a necromancer who kept to a cave network in a deep and haunted wood. You've done some morally questionable things during your service, but they've never bothered you much. But when your master's studies led to more dangerous pursuits, you discovered you'd rather go down a path that didn't risk your skin for someone else's gain.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: An affluent life has given me certain expectations. Music is divine, but public dancing is grotesque.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Poise. The performance of good deportment is no small part of power and influence.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A member of high society took me under their wing and promoted me above my middle-class station; I owe everything to them.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My spending sometimes exceeds my means.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Raised in a rough and tumble frontier settlement, there was always an opportunity for the small to advance through various means. Though you come from somewhat humble beginnings (your father was the town smith), you've always aspired to wealth and position. You got into liquor distillation and had been doing well for yourself under the tutelage of an old-money mentor. That all changed when your business went up in smoke (literally) as a fire swept through the settlement, leaving you unsure of what's next.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Thinking too hard about a subject rarely does any good. I'm an action-oriented individual with small patience for conversation.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Nationalism. I will fight to defend my country, no matter the cost.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I love my nation's royal family more than my own, and would gladly give my whole life's blood to spare a drop of theirs.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Obsequious is a word I've heard used to describe me as an insult, but I feel it's anything but so long as you're servile to your betters alone.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You come from a family of pig farmers whom you regarded as low and pathetic, despite the wholesome upbringing they provided you. You lied about your age to enter into the army at the age of 14 and had worked your way up to the position of Staff Sergeant. However, after an embarrassing incident during which you brutalized a civilian for speaking ill of the crown, you were dismissed from your post and given a small plot of land. There's no way you'll go there to die, though. You've decided to strike out into the wider world instead, and find a new use for your martial acumen.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Short-fused, bombastic, and prone to tirades, I'm not shy about letting people know when I disagree. However, I am a fierce friend once won over.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Anarchy. Power should not be allowed to centralize or consolidate -- ever.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A ragtag crew of insurgents I've run with for awhile. We have only each other to depend on.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I hate the powerful without discretion, and hiding that fact has never been my priority.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A tyrannical cabal of demon-worshippers has ruled your town since your youth. They've held public executions of innocent people you know, and the nature of the executions indicates ritualistic killings rather than penal ones. Part of a resistance movement, you've left your town in order to help them. If you can just understand the lore that surrounds this cabal, you may finally be able to hold these bastards to account.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: A born storyteller, my motto is 'never let the truth ruin a good tale.' I have a healthy appetite for diversion and gambling.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Exploration. With one life to live and a boundless world to explore, my mission in life has always seemed plain.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> The road and the sea are the only bonds I need, as I try not to be tied down by any person, place, or thing.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I despise dogmatically religious people, regardless of their character.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You barely remember to spell the name of the hamlet where you were born. Your wanderlust was an innate trait shared by none of your kith or kin, and so you decided to leave it all behind once you came of age. You've wrestled sailors, run for your life from haunted woods, and heard stories from all manner of folk. The only thing that's been missing from your life is a loyal band of adventurers to share in your successes and defeats, to shield your back, and to bring greater meaning to your existence.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I have a mercurial temperament that folks around me often find jarring. My one constant is a quick tongue.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Wit. A good turn of phrase shows a sharp mind worth listening to.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A local innkeeper raised me better than my own kin ever did, and I pay her homage whenever I can.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm extremely impatient and prone to outbursts at the slightest delay of plans.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Raised more in the open streets of a bustling city than in your own home, you've had a challenging yet fulfilling life. You've always had a keener eye and sharper tongue than most, which hasn't gone unnoticed by middle-class patrons willing to overlook your breeding for your brains. You aspire to intelligent company, but lately, you've been feeling a bit provincial beside your peers, and so have decided to strike out into the world to put your wit to the test.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I take a calculated approach to any situation, because that's how you produce optimal results. I'm also drawn to high places with wide views.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Reason. Emotion only gets in the way of making rational decisions.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My grandfather gave me a book entitled 'Logic: Why Familial Artifacts Should Not Hold Significance in Your Life' -- I cherish it dearly.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Try as I might to reason it away, I'm compulsively drawn to steal small trinkets, even from friends.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You grew up in a mostly backward community with a few bastions of good sense -- chief among them being your grandfather, a local Wizard, and an itinerant Cleric who passes through every year or so. On the Cleric's last visit, you decided to follow him out of your aimless existence. While traveling, you climbed a tree to scout the road ahead. The Cleric was waylaid by Gnolls and you were powerless to help him. You now harbor an intense hatred for the creatures, and you'd also like to tell your grandfather what happened when you get a chance.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I have an abiding love for wondrous magic. Raised by rather eccentric folk, I've also turned to obsessive compulsions as a way of establishing some semblance of order and regularity in my life.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Transparency. To conceal any pertinent truth is as bad as lying outright.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> An original tome of Perspicus Ensite, a revered wizard of my school.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Diplomacy has never been my strong suit, as I see little difference between honeyed words and manipulation.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You grew up in something of a magical monastery, where professors, priests, and wizards were constantly hungry for new subjects of study. Your interest in the subject was also genuine and you tried to serve in whatever way you could, but the cutthroat elitist nature of the enclave eventually turned you off. Knowledge for its own sake and a free hand at your research -- that's all you're after now that you've cut ties with your community.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Daring and opinionated, I've always seemed to get away with acts of boldness. While practical, I won't be told what to do if I see some way around it.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Self-reliance. You can't trust your community if it's ruled by evil.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I left behind an old man who was my mentor and a niece I love dearly; I hope to see them again one day.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My instinct to hide my true nature and desires makes me difficult to trust.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were raised in a dragon cult, serving an ancient red dragon with an insatiable thirst for wealth and status. Not only were you tasked with bringing her rare works of great power and beauty from dangerous locations, but also with spying on other red dragons in the wider area. On your last mission, you were left for dead -- a blessing as you see it. You are finally free to make your own destiny, though you hold some hope to one day release your friends from the red dragon's tyrannical rule.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I like talking to people; there's no better way to gain an advantage. My ambition knows no bounds, but I'm not blinded by it.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Influence. Knowledge is power, especially knowledge of the powerful</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I keep a worthless amulet from my first job as a reminder not to waste my time with dirty work.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Insecurity haunts me, especially around my lisp.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were living proof that a life of crime can pay. From a scrappy nobody, you were taken into a family that demanded loyalty but made good on its promise of shared prosperity. Ambitious to a fault, you flew too close to the sun and got a target put on your back. Caught in your machinations, you made the smart move and decided to run -- for now.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Gregarious, generous, and gay, I've always been easy company. The luck that's followed me has made such an attitude simple to maintain.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Efficiency. Why work harder when you can work smarter?</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My family was your greatest treasure, until the tragedy.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I hum nervously in the presence of disorder.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A power from beyond reached out and blessed you with incredible fortune. A lovely spouse, an adoring family, and a comfortable position in a safe community. But the bill came due, and your one-time patron took that all from you in a show of her ultimate authority. Vengeance, fear, supplication -- what drives you from here is entirely yours to decide.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I don't know whose nose has been broken more, mine or those I've brawled with. If you think you can cheat me, is I'd like to show you my necklace of ears from those who made the same mistake.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Beastial. Life's chief aim and pleasure is sating our primal thirsts.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> Never had much use for bonding, but I've slept with the same dagger beneath my pillow for near a decade.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> A rough nature and an unfiltered mouth make for many a conflict.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A mercenary for companies of varying repute and success, you've sold your service in combat for years. In battle, you're bold, but not stupid; violent, but not cruel. Acts of physicality are all that drive you, and the carnal pleasure that your income fuels is simply a perk of the lifestyle. You're willing to fall in with a regular band as long as they keep their yaps shut about your oddities.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I try not to blink, and I've mastered the art of sleeping with one eye open. If the undead need no rest, then neither do I.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Sanctity. Some of the undead were once good people, and all efforts should be made to sanctify their remains. </p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My partner, killed in a senseless zombie attack.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> It's my plan or no plan; I hear this attitude grates on people.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Part religious cult, part zombie-killing gang, you've been blessed with an interesting life. Most of your order's members came from families or villages that were ravaged by the undead. Tired of being the victim to these foul and unnatural creatures, you and your gang are proactive undead hunters -- at least you were until your stealth mission went wrong and you and your party all went insane from a demilich's curse. You've only recently regained your memory of your past, and you're eager to return to your vocation.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I've been called queer before, and it's true I don't behave as others do. I dream of a different life, on a higher plane of existence.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Reverie. Intense reflection is a grand source of supernatural inspiration.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A strange woman whose face I've never seen; I follow her words without question.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I rapidly blink my eyes when giving or receiving a compliment.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You've been contacted by a mysterious stranger throughout your life. Sometimes with gifts, other times with orders. You've never seen her face, and her hair and voice seem different each time you encounter her, but there seems an otherworldly aura surrounding her that is constant. You fear her and love her, and it's been 5 years since she commanded you to leave your home. Since then, it's been nothing but silence.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm fiercely loyal but unafraid to speak truth to power. I'm also most comfortable in an advisory position.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Fellowship. Without companions, life is but a shadow.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My family, my king, my country.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> A silly combination of outspokenness and servility leads me to make bold warnings that are ultimately toothless.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Your uncle served the king, and you served his heir — the true heir. His crown was stolen by a ruthless stepsister and her powerful cabal of eunuchs. You fought for and councilor the would-be king, but his foolhardy decision to override your advice led to his violent death. Now you have a choice to make -- is his fight your own now, or do you let the dead rest and make a new life for yourself?</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I count the creatures I've hunted on the notches of my staff to remind me. The chase is what I live for.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Harmony. I have a deep respect for the beasts I kill, and I honor especially challenging foes once slain.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I had a hunting falcon for nigh on five years, but she recently passed during a hunt.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Every insult I've ever borne is etched upon my soul, and I take petty vengeance where I can.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Raised in a nomadic band of trappers, hunters, and gatherers, you've always valued a life close to nature. Gems, coins, and banknotes -- these mean very little to your people, who consider spirituality to be of paramount importance. From your younger years, you've been marked as an exceptional hunter with boundless potential. On a hunt one year ago, you were knocked from a waterfall by a mountain cat. You've only just remembered who you are and where you come from, though the accident did nothing to alter your skills as a hunter and your irascible personality.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I try to be easy-going, but I've got a chip on my shoulder from always being distrusted. Dancing is what I miss the most about being a part of my clan.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Redemption. Everyone deserves a chance to clear their name and start anew.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My childhood friend, lost to me in the Feywild -- I <i>will</i> find out what happened to them.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm very sensitive about being blamed for my mistakes.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> As a teen, you went exploring an enchanted forest with a friend. The two of you suddenly and unexpectedly crossed into the Feywild. Awestruck at first, your friend soon became fearful and ran from you. While searching for him, you stumbled on an old crone who gave you three seeds and showed you the way back to the material plane. Your friend never returned, and you've never been able to make the seeds grow or do anything at all. Since the incident, your clan looks on you with trepidation, and so you've decided it's best to start a new life for yourself elsewhere, and maybe discover the secrets of the seeds while you're at it.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: If everyone else is going to be cruel, I suppose I should be as well. I don't care how my appetites are satisfied, so long as they are.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Vitality. The threat of instant death is the best stimulant I know. </p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I keep a lock of hair from my first...object of admiration.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Most regard me as a foul creep.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You stumbled upon the demon amulet of a fiend. Since then, you've tortured and manipulated the fiend to achieve your selfish and depraved ends. In doing so, you've become something of a fiend yourself; or rather, the fiend within has been allowed full expression. But the unthinkable happened, and the demon amulet was destroyed. Now you have a year and a day to prepare for the demon's return.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: My face doesn't make expressions, as a rule. I'm drawn to violent imagery and dark lore.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Degradation. Everything will crumble eventually; why not speed things along?</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My pet snake, whom I was forced to release into the wild once my sister found him.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I often forget to eat for days at a time, until I swoon.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You grew up in a strictly religious and puritanical family. Toil and suffering were outward expressions of divine grace, and so you were always worked to exhaustion. Additionally, showing emotion was a sign of great shame, and so you have few facial expressions. While you never rebelled against the lifestyle openly, you had a fascination with necromancer lore and were caught dabbling in dark magic. It brought such shame upon your house that you were permanently exiled and disowned, forced to roam the world with a very provincial and strange view of things.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I handle myself with proper etiquette at all times. But I've also been told I'm prone to pontification.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Stoicism. Our only choice is how to react to the vicissitudes of fortune.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My guild president pin, which marked my position for 4 years.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I do take myself and my pride rather seriously.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were a respected member of the community, an artisan of no small skill. Until a traveling mishap landed you in a  garden where you helped yourself to some provisions — a witch's garden, turned out. For your transgression, The witch cursed you with the loss of your eyebrows and legs that dance when music is played, no matter the situation. Your quirks have mostly been accepted, but not by you — you'd like to find the old crone and reverse the curse.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I can adapt and blend into any environment. But if I see an abuse of authority, my charade will drop in a rage.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Perserverance. Life involves suffering, but that is the price of joy.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A kind old woman taught me to read as a child. I visit her grave whenever I can.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I have a tough time dropping a first impression, especially if I perceive a bully.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Ever since you were young, you've been treated like dirt. A cruel mistress at the orphanage, the corrupt thugs who serve as town guards, and nobles sending you off to fight in pointless shows of force. But through it all, the dreams. Strong as a child, then faint for some time, but now returned. Dreams of a voice like chiming bells, and visions of an Elven form. She calls to you, and hints at a secret power with you. Now on the frontier with only an oafish commanding officer as an authority, you feel an urge to run -- to find the source of these dreams, and to learn more of your destiny.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I do not have much to say, and most do not say much to me once they have seen me close. My guard is always up and I do not trust as a rule.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Survival. We all do what we must to survive, and morality has naught to do with it.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I keep a trinket from my former master; it is a reminder that cruelty has no bounds.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I expect loyalty, but I do not offer it.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You did what you had to do. You were just a slave like anyone else -- and the Efreet do not treat their slaves kindly. Somehow, you found some measure of success as an overseer. If you were cruel, it was to serve your master and buy yourself a quantum of solace. But your master was destroyed -- a blessing and a new set of problems. You found a way to blend in with the slaves to avoid punishment for your cruelties; what you do with your freedom is up to you. Are you haunted by your despicable past, or have years of abuse and abusing hardened your heart completely?</p>"'<p><b>Personality Traits: My love of lore gets in the way of focusing on the here and now. Still, I'm one of the more proactive and adventurous among my community.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Tradition. Without history and ritual, we are lost.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My order is everything to me, and I do everything to uphold its traditions and values of balance.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> If I witness any good divinity -- especially my own -- being profaned, I <i>will</i> react with violence.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> They stole it from you. You had the first half of the Everliving Moon, an ancient relic sacred to your religion, but it was stolen by ignoble thieves or actors bent on more sinister ends. Your people are no cowards, but neither are they warriors. Among them all, only you have shown a talent for adventure. That is why you have been quested with the half-moon's retrieval, once you have seen something of the world and grown in experience. Perhaps your path will even lead you across the moon's second half, a dream your people haven't dared to dream in your lifetime.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Smiles have come to me as easy as luck thus far in life. The finer things in life are fine indeed, but simple pleasures are those I favor.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Showmanship. Life is but a game, and I aim to be its finest player.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My partners, killed on a job that was bigger than we anticipated -- I live to serve their families now.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My confidence often runs to arrogance, especially when dealing with a loathsome target.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You and your partners had it all figured out. From petty thefts as street urchins to sophisticated long cons on nobles, you had risen to considerable wealth -- and notoriety. Your unerring success also led to greater, more dangerous ambitions. Wealth long ago ceased to matter to you and your crew; it became about exposing the corrupt and creating a spectacle. Or it was. Until you were caught in the middle of a plot to rob a duke of the better part of his estate. Your partners were killed, but you managed to get away, practically penniless.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I have an unshakeable serenity no matter the situation. People who are swayed by emotion are easy targets and poor friends.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Distinction. To distinguish oneself with honor and skill is the ultimate aim of a true warrior.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My weapon, given to me by my first master as a symbol of my rise in rank.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I have no patience, sympathy, or compassion for those who fail to help themselves.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were raised in a military outpost and learned to fight from an early age. Between Orc raiders, beasts from the forest's edge, and demonic incursions, it's fair to say that your upbringing was never dull. While on a ritual hunting journey into the forest itself, the outpost was completely destroyed, with hints of necromantic activity. You've been trained to exact revenge, but with no leads to go on and no resources to speak of, you've been selling your sword for the past year, always with an ear to the ground for some hint of what happened to your people.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: If I make a promise, I will keep it, no matter the cost. My gruff exterior conceals a gentle nature.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Liberty. Those who impose their will on others must be eliminated.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I wear the bracelet of my brother who was killed for stealing food for a child.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> A childhood accident has left me deadly afraid of heights.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You saw your small village become a warlord's chattel in the space of a year. In another two, you found yourself leading a rebellion that ended with the warlord's death and the emancipation of your people. To ensure the continued safety of your people, you pursued each and every enemy who escaped and eliminated them one by one. Though your people worship you as a hero, you have no appetite to rule or even to resume your once peaceful life. Now that you know what suffering can be, you've made it your mission to deliver the same fate to tyrants everywhere.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I've been accused of pedantry and a passion for erudition. It's true I view philistines as little better than beasts.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Sublimity. The lofty pursuit of education is the most worthy one can undertake.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I have been working on a history of my home region for nigh my lifetime.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> If forced into close proximity to persistent idiocy, I cannot help insulting the source.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Blessed has been your life, for one of your nature. Born into wealth, privilege, and access to the grandest resources available, your life has been a continuous pursuit of knowledge. But source material is not always available in academies or private libraries -- ruins and long-forgotten places contain gaps in your understanding that gnaw at you ceaselessly. That's why you went out in search of a storied site of local legend and wound up stepping through the Feywild, and out again -- halfway across the world.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm very fond of quick-witted conversation. I've been called soft on servants for allowing them too much freedom.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Charity. It is oh so important that we give to the poor, without implementing any institutional change.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My title of nobility, which I keep to remind me of the vicissitudes of life.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I have an extreme vulnerability for a pretty face and a weakness for sensual pleasures.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were always kind to your peasants, which is why you were shocked when the rebellion came. Those rowdy serfs beat down your door, slew your guard, and turned all the material wealth out of your home. That you survived at all was a miracle, but you hardly knew what to do with yourself out in the wild in nothing but your nightclothes. Though you maintain a vague hope of one day reclaiming your title and your lands, you know it's an unlikely proposition. Strange as it may seem, you're exhilarated to begin life anew and test your spirit now that you've been stripped of status.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I value my self-sufficiency and quick action. I never make a move until I've fully assessed a situation.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Independence. There is no greater freedom than being able to provide entirely for yourself.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I became separated from my clan, and have not seen them for years.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I detest dirty and disorganized creatures, and cannot stand for unclean conditions.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> When your clan was surrounded by Bullywugs, it was you who led the charge against them. While that made you a hero among your people, it made you a target of the Bullywug Queen, Buma. You were captured, blindfolded, and transported to a deep swamp, where you were presented before Buma. You served as her court jester, played to her narcissism, and eventually broke free. Though you tried for years to locate your clan, you have been unsuccessful. Without kith or kin, you long for a group to once more serve as a family.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I am constantly taking note of my surroundings, natural terrain, and the potential advantages they could afford me. Strategy games can hold my attention for hours.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Battle. I live for the thrill of combat and the triumph of victory.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I have a special connection with horses, and feel most complete while astride one.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Intrigue, subterfuge, and trickery enrage me and offend my sense of fair play.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You've been fighting in wars since you were old enough to fit into the uniform, and you're a damn good soldier. Wars of expansion, mercenary skirmishes, full-scale sieges; officer's tents, frontline trenches, castle walls -- if there's a side of war you haven't seen, you've yet to hear tell of it. You had no reason to think of anything else; soldiering suited your nature and your skills. Until one of the fey enchanted you and you began asking questions about why you serve, behaving solely as a martial instrument for the benefit of others? Desertion soon followed, and now an unknown path before you.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm happy to be the butt of a joke if it brings a bit of joy. My love of drink and story-telling are well-known.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Community. We all ought to help each other out when we can.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My best spent time is with orphaned youths.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I don't see much value in personal hygiene and think less of those who think overmuch of it.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Literally born in the gutter, you've always had a cheerful attitude despite your benighted lot. Whether begging for coin or capering for a drink, you're generally well-liked thanks to your kindly words and trustworthy face. Recently, something's changed. A small gemstone given to you by a stranger has begun to communicate with you telepathically -- it hints of a fate beyond the bounds of your squalid city, and of untapped powers you possess. Without any real connections to hold you back, you figure there's not much to lose by following a gemstone's guidance.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: While I have a love of all things old, I'm not your typical bookish sort. Although I'm typically kind myself, I prefer making friends with interesting people, regardless of their morality.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Curiosity. Boredom cannot exist while there's something yet to learn.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I keep a strange artifact my father found on one of our digs; he always wanted to discover what its purpose was.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I often thoughtlessly endanger myself to satisfy my inquisitive itch. </p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You've been an explorer, archaeologist, and historian from before you could even walk on your own two feet. Like your family and the small community you belonged to, you have an endless drive toward puzzles and an abiding love of mystery. But the long-forgotten places your people delved were not forgotten by all -- as your people learned to their dismay. You barely escaped the lamia's lair alive; the rest of your people were not so fortunate. Your passion for discovery ebbed almost completely enough so as to forget your life before, and the pain of its sudden end. But now, a new adventure calls, and with it new companions who have reinvigorated a joy you've not known in many hard years.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I've been told I'm as solemn as a tree stump, but that's just how I appear. I do have a rather inflexible mind, once I've decided on the right course of action.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Tradition. The customs and codes of my people are good and wise; to break from them is to break from the people and land itself.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I wear a woven reed bracelet always, a gift from my daughter.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I am honest to a fault and am quick to trust strangers.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Between forest and fen, your people have dwelled for time immemorial, unknown or forgotten to civilization. Mostly peaceful hunter/gatherers, your people express warfare through kidnapping, ransom, and plunder -- to kill outside of ceremony is considered the greatest disgrace, and grounds for permanent exile from any clan. So when you accidentally killed a rival clan member in a raid, you didn't bother returning to your family; better they believe you dead than bring upon the shame of an exiled partner and parent. You've never spoken about the killing aloud, and it would take great faith in a companion to entrust them with this secret.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I enjoy the company of all sorts with equal pleasure, though I've never made a habit of long-term friendship. I can get a bit frustrated when an idea doesn't work out as planned.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Tack. The fastest road is not always the wisest course.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> Though my horse changes as my job demands, I develop a deep connection with each I ride.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I easily give in to envy, and am unfailingly rude to those who have what I want.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were a courier for years, enjoying the vagaries of the open road. Life carried on smoothly from saddle to barstool for a time, until you got caught up in the machinations of a rebel force seeking to supplant a local power. Unbeknownst to you, a contract you took involved the delivery of an artifact that would have delegitimized this local power. Though you quickly handed it over to the sovereign's agents when they confronted you, and swore secrecy on pain of death, you still found it wise to depart the realm you've always known. So you've set out for new lands and, while trepidatious, you hope to find more bold and adventurous companions for whatever's next.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I've become a bit defensive from years of bullying, but I've also learned to stand up for myself and others. I usually get away with doing as I like now because I'm better at apologizing than asking for permission.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Reciprocity. Loyalty is earned, and only a fool gives it freely.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A small stone marked with a rune, which my adopted family found me with as a baby.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> A childhood run-in with a mage left me deadly afraid of illusionists.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were found as a baby, bearing a small stone with a strange rune carved into it. You've always looked different than those around you, as if you came from a far-off realm. Nevertheless, you were raised among thieves of a more-or-less honorable sort. Your childhood was spent learning the tricks of the trade and participating in all manner of petty crimes. But when a wizard passed through a town you were in, you couldn't resist the urge to ask about the stone and the rune that marked it. Though he claimed to know not what it meant and was gone the next day, you suspect he was holding something back. And so you've broken from your humble adopted family in search of answers of your origin, and whatever secrets lie behind the rune.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I nod at a consistent rhythm while listening to someone speak, and never make eye contact. While my face expresses emotions and I have feelings, the two rarely seem to be in sync.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Mindfulness. I cherish a mind that is my own.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I have a hidden place in my mind that I retreat to sometimes.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> The sound of bells is absolute torture for me.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Raised in a cult led by a powerful enchantress, your true life of autonomy and self-determination only began a short time ago. She fell at the hands of adventurers who simply set you free without considering where you'd go or what you'd do. While all your many years in her service are a haze to you, you've been left with a few strange talents (as well as some odd quirks). Though your life has been in many ways tragic, you have a rich internal world. And now, with your newfound freedom, it seems only proper to find equal richness in the wider world before you.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I spend much of my time in altered states of consciousness. If you can get over my airy and indirect approach, you'll find I'm often insightful.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Fate. The stars write our stories; to fight destiny is to suffer needlessly.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I've charted the course of a rogue planet all my life, keeping diligent notes on its odd movements.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm terribly dependent on a hallucinogenic cocktail of my own design.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> An astronomer and soothsayer, you've led a life dictated by the heavens themselves. In your long years of seclusion, you've been a near-constant user of a cocktail that brings you into contact with other realms, planes, and truths of reality. You've also traded your services as an oracle, shaman, and spirit guide for those wise enough to find your migratory camp. Though your life is as you like it, recent portents indicate a growing ecological threat to an herb that's vital to the production of your cocktail. Furthermore, astrological readings leave you in little doubt that change and conflict are upon you, whether you would will it or not.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: Don't take it personally if I don't trust you right away; experience has been a harsh teacher on that front. Despite it all, I have a generous disposition, especially if a bit of revelry is on.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Stoicism. You can't control the chaos of the cosmos, but you can seek stillness in it.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I dedicate myself to delivering spiritual peace to those who harbor righteous hatred.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm often accused of roping others into misfortune, but their lives could usually use the excitement anyway, as I see it.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Your brother was always a pompous ass -- that was no secret. But that he would seek to take every last drop of your inheritance when you made no aggressive claims at all? That you did not expect. At the time, you counted yourself lucky for your uncle, who took you into his humble farm and helped set you on your feet. You counted yourself lucky, until your uncle cheated you out of your real inheritance; the key to a lockbox that your parents never told you the location of. Cheated by all those who were close to you and sickened by family, you've left your home in search of companionship of a higher quality.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I loath my habit of wincing whenever sharp words are spoken, even if they're not directed at me. Highly fantastic plots of revenge and power occupy my recreation time.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Restraint. One should always hold back until one sure stroke can finish the job.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I keep the badges of my former teachers, to remind myself of the lasting benefits of close study.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I struggle to respond in the moment with decisive action, and often get bullied into compliance as a result.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You always hated wizards, and with good reason. So what if you were an odd duck from the start and made uncomfortable comments and thoughtless remarks? That was no reason to berate you, humiliate you, and torture -- yes, torture -- you, all the while professing nobility and wisdom. Arrogant windbags! They deserved it, no doubt, when you set fire to their tower. When you made off with their badges, those tokens of 'honor' that always marked them above you. How the tower burned like a candle, and their screams filled the night like no wind you'd heard before. Yes, it's much quieter now, and you finally have room to grow and learn. But best to keep your grisly past to yourself, lest others get the wrong idea and mark <i>you</i> a villain!</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: People who think too long tend to be slow; I enjoy taking things from slow people. While I've always settled things with my fists in the past, I'm starting to doubt the wisdom of this style of conflict resolution.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Animal cunning. People think the brainy sorts have a monopoly on smarts, but you need only watch a predator at work to know that instinct is its own intelligence.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A goblet made of the former warlord's skull -- a worthy foe.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My recent experiences have left me paranoid, especially with as many enemies as I've made.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Your relationship with skulls is two-fold; crushing some, and drinking from others. You didn't exactly choose the life of a warlord, but the weak chattel around you and your unabashed love of violence earned you the privilege without much trouble. After sufficient skull-crushing, the operation more or less ran itself, and you enjoyed your fair share of luxury goods, a never-ending cycle of new bed-pals, and the occasional thrill of showing internal insurgents that you still retained your skull-crushing ability. That is, until the brains of your operation decided it was best to poison you slowly rather than challenge you head-on. Weakened and forgetful of much of your former life after awakening from a long and frenzied fever, you've resolved to regain your strength. Whether you regain your former bloodlust remains to be seen.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I don't always mean to manipulate people; it's just second nature. I have a talent for sounding authoritative on any topic, even when I haven't a clue.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Purpose. Those who have not fashioned their own purpose are easily used by those who have.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I've been secretly writing a play for years, and would love to see it produced one day.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I may have an inflated sense of my own omniscience at times.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You once ran a rather successful cult, based mainly around blackmail, coerced group violence, and financial bilking. Of course, that wasn't the draw -- no, you offered spiritual salvation. Quite an easy sell to a town of idiots who lived in constant fear and reverence of an active volcano in their midst. But when you won the soul of the chief magistrate's own husband, you crossed a line. She had a nearby town send their army to slaughter your cult, and only a tip from a loyal spy got you out alive with your head. That was some years ago now, and you've settled into a much more modest life of swindling in recent days. But you miss having an inner circle, a gang -- one that trusts you implicitly and completely. Who knows, you may even be willing to reciprocate that trust with the right companions.</p>', <p><b>Personality Traits: I'm twitchy and prone to unpredictable mood swings. My one constant is a love of music, which can calm me down no matter the situation.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Extremity. Both the highest highs and the lowest lows have their charms.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A set of dice that are known to be lucky from time to time.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My addictive personality leads to many conflicts with friends, and my concentration slips when I'm feeling low.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You had a moderately comfortable childhood, but your father was a merchant who was hated by all in the community for taking advantage of their need. When a fight broke out and your father was killed, even the magistrate looked the other way. You departed not long after, at a young age, and found that you enjoyed your life of modest adventure. But gambling, drinking, and other vices led to many a scuffle, and many a quiet midnight departure from whichever town you chose to haunt. But lately, you've been feeling an urge for a genuine family -- or maybe you're just onto a more sophisticated scam where a team of adventurers can lead you to grander treasures than you could hope to acquire alone. Whatever the result, you feel certain that your solitary life is nearly at an end.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: Unfailingly honest and direct, I've been accused of rudeness when I have no intention to offend. Games can capture my attention for hours, but I'm always a good sport in defeat.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Equitability. From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My crew meant everything to me, and their voices still inspire everything I do.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm extremely dogmatic and will put down a good idea that goes against my personal ideology.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You had it all figured out. You and your ragtag group of conspirators had the perfect plan for removing the local tyrant who ruled your modest hamlet with an iron fist. Little did you know that you had a traitor in your midst. Every one of your core companions was slain in a raid, and you only chanced to survive due to a delay on a scouting mission you went on that day. The traitor, your former 'sister,' knows that you survived and won't cease her search for you until you've been eliminated. For now, you've decided it's best to lay low. But you've also vowed to put a stop to the hunt for your head, one way or another. If not for revenge, then simply to take a target off your back.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: Gregarious and boastful, I'm actually deeply insecure about my popularity and ability. Contrary as a rule, I love a friendly argument.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Flippancy. People who demand solemnity are usually engaged in absurdity.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> My old home might not have been especially kind to me, but I feel an affinity for the people who live there.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I have a deep fear of all mind-related magic, and am scared witless of mind control and possession.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You've always told big tales and you've lived a strange enough life that they're almost entirely true. But one tale was not meant to go out -- how you accidentally killed a local lord's son on a hunting trip. There was only one witness, who possesses evidence of your deed, but she agreed to throw his body off a seaside cliff and claim it was an accident. Since then, she's blackmailed you with a piece of the lad's tabard, pierced by your signature arrowhead. You decided to abandon your home and everything you knew rather than live under her shadow any longer, but hope to one day return home to clear your name.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: I have a fascination with ships, although I've never seen one (or the sea) in my life. I have a strong sense of self-esteem, even if I don't often assert myself.</p><p><b>Ideals: Exchange.</b> Two parties always share a mutual interest where trade is possible. </p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A cache of old coins I was forced to leave behind in my rapid exit; it's worth a small fortune, and I hope to retrieve it one day.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> Fear of missing out on an opportunity (especially a profitable one) can induce me to do silly things.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A bounty on your head -- who could imagine?! You'd always dealt evenly and honestly with merchants and tradespeople, and you made a living you were comfortable with. So when a crime syndicate approached you with a 'special job,' you politely but firmly told them you weren't interested. When they asked more forcefully a second time, you went to a patrol for help. What reason would you have to expect that the constable had taken the syndicate's coin a long time ago? With a price on your head and the law inclined to look the other way, you thought it wise to depart and make a new start.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: I have endless enthusiasm for my research, no matter the cost. Airy and aloof, I have trouble concentrating on events occurring in front of me.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Experimentation. I never stop thinking of new inventions and approaches.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I owe a great deal of money to various moneylenders, friends, and family members and intend to settle my debts eventually.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My insatiable thirst for discovery leads to a reckless disregard to personal cost and collateral damage.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You are not a typical debtor. While some borrow for vices or to keep their business or household afloat, your vice seemed much more innocent -- education. Yet as you (and everyone with a coin to lend) have learned, books, reagents, and alchemical equipment are far from cheap. But what was once a small annoyance for your kin has become a sizeable debt worthy of enforcers that come from the limb-snapping school of debt collection. Seeing as it's hard to work under such conditions, you've hit the open road in search of payment for your talents in order to settle your debts and regain the freedom to pursue your scientific work.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: I blink a lot in the sun, the sight of which I'm still not quite accustomed to. I take notes ceaselessly, as I have a terrible fear of forgetting an important detail.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Duty. When a noble and heavy task falls to me, I see it through no matter the cost.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> An underground lake that I've always kept secret and enjoyed as a private sanctuary.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> The presence of birds disturbs me, and I distrust them as a species.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Yours was a happy and even whimsical upbringing. Living in a cave network, you and your people tinkered with experiments of both the magical and mechanical variety. A dab hand at most anything you put your mind to, you were called on to solve the seismic shifts that threaten your civilization's very existence. It is now your solemn duty to venture forth into the wider world to find an answer to the greatest challenge your people have ever faced.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: Being proven wrong is my greatest insecurity. I become extremely aggravated when a plan begins to go off the rails.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Reason. Everything can be understood and explained by a sufficiently advanced mind.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I may not have a lot in common with my family, but reuniting them is up to me.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I'm terrified of any body of water I can't stand up in.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> Your childhood was far from boring, what with two magical parents and a magical older sister. Your family's obsession with all things magical led to a rebellious streak, and you opted to pursue science instead. In a failed experiment with teleportation magic, your mother, father, and sister were all sent to random locations around the world. Although you were always the odd duck in the family, you still feel a sense of duty to find and return them. But you're also no fool, and know that it's dangerous to go alone. That's why you've joined up with adventurers -- who better to start off with when you've no idea where to begin searching? </p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: Quiet and evenminded, I do my best to attract no notice. I'm fascinated with geology and natural phenomena.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Faithfulness. The fidelity of my word cannot be questioned.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> A strange stone I found in the Feywild that changes colors with the weather.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> I always rush toward the quickest conclusion, even if it means taking the more dangerous path.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> You were lost, and very young, when a fey found you and returned you to your home. They agreed to bring you back on one condition -- that you would one day return the favor, no matter the cost. Though you forgot about your promise over the years, you were quickly reminded when the fey returned one morning when you were alone. They reminded you of the favor you owe, but haven't named the deed yet. Instead, they've indicated that you need to leave the life you know and join up with certain adventurers for now -- their plan, and your role in it, will be revealed with time.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: My eyes glow with painful passion, and I lick my lips when I speak about a topic that excites me. I spend hours writing manifestos that I never share with anyone.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Obsession. Whatever one says of my life, they won't say it was half-lived.</p><p><b>Bonds:</b> Shane, my messiah, martyred and destined to come again.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> All undead creatures scare me completely senseless.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> She was glorious the first time you saw her. And she was glorious the last time as well, when they burned her for a heretic. Her movement was short-lived, and she hardly spoke two words to you during your unremarkable tenure in her school. But still you obsess over her teachings and her charisma. Shane was everything to you, and you're convinced she never really died, but was transmuted in the fire. Luckily, you had enough wits to flee your home regardless of your fervent belief in a banned religion and its messiah. But your obsession burns on -- you <i>know</i> you'll play a part in her return, or at the very least help her live on through spreading the gospel she taught.</p>', '<p><b>Personality Traits: I'm as dirty as anyone you'll ever meet, except for my hands, which I wash religiously. I can seem uncaring toward people, but I'm quick to help anyone who's in danger.</p><p><b>Ideals:</b> Animalism. All the beasts of the world are my kin. </p><p><b>Bonds:</b> I am connected to all the world's beasts, but I feel a special bond with frogs and toads.</p><p><b>Flaws:</b> My love of beasts causes me to underestimate their danger and be timid about attacking them directly -- even in self-defense.</p></br><p><b>Background:</b> A member of a jungle-dwelling tribe, you never quite fit into your society. While they lived to hunt, you lived to heal the wildlife of your region; even the predators that your tribe saw as devilish incarnations. That is why you were cast out, and why you've spent the last several years in solitude -- besides the sick creatures you've cared for. Your gift comes with a great responsibility to protect all the creatures of the world, as you see it. But as tragedy befalls many a tribe in your region, you've been blamed as the mystical source of all their woes. And so you've decided to leave the only place you've known, but never to stop helping the beasts you encounter.</p>']
